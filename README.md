# Dreamers-Dilemma
A simple beginner text-based adventure game made with Python via Pycharm.



## General Information
Dreamer's Dilemma is a quick text-based adventure game where the player gets stuck inside a dream world. It's made entirely with Python and the app PyCharm. The game is played through the player's input; the player moves through different scenarios until they get one of the six endings. 

## Features
The game utilises the following code features:
- Functions
- Input Functions
- If, Elif, and Else Statements
- Lists

## Setup
To play Dreamer's Dilemma, you need to run the .py file through a Python IDE such as PyCharm. As the game is text-based, no additional programs are required.

## Modules 
To complete this game, I used the following modules:
- Time: To build suspense/space out text shown on screen.
- Random: To randomise certain outcomes.


## Room for Improvement 
Dreamer's Dilemma could be improved in a manner of ways:
- Expanding on / Creating new scenes to make the game longer
- Include more random/ challenging scenarios to prevent the game from feeling stale upon replay.
- Creating other ways for players to engage with the game could help it stay engaging.
